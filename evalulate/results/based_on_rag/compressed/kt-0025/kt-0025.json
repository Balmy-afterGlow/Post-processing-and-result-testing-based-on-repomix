{
  "reason": "The issue highlights that the current documentation for `Flow.timeout` suggests using a generic `catch{}` operator without specifying how to handle `TimeoutCancellationException` specifically, which could lead to unintended handling of other exceptions.",
  "location": [
    "kotlinx-coroutines-core/common/src/flow/operators/Delay.kt"
  ],
  "fix": "Update the documentation example to explicitly handle `TimeoutCancellationException` by checking the exception type in the `catch` block and rethrowing other exceptions. The suggested fix is to modify the example to include: `.catch { exception -> if (exception is TimeoutCancellationException) { emit(-1) } else { throw exception } }`"
