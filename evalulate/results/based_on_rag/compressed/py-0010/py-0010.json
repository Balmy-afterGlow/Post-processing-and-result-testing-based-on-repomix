  "reason": "The issue is caused by using floating-point division in the arithmetic series sum calculation, which leads to imprecise results. The correct approach should use integer division to maintain precision.",

  "fix": "Replace the floating-point division with integer division in the arithmetic series sum calculation. Change the line `sum_of_series = (n * (n + 1)) / 2` to `sum_of_series = (n * (n + 1)) // 2`."
