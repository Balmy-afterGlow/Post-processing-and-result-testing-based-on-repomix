  "reason": "The NullPointerException occurs in the interestsScrollTopicsDownUp function, likely because the UI element being interacted with is not found or not yet loaded when the function is called.",

Modify the interestsScrollTopicsDownUp function to include a wait for the element to be present. For example:\n\nfun MacrobenchmarkScope.interestsScrollTopicsDownUp() {\n    val topicsList = device.findObject(By.res(\"topics_list\"))\n    device.wait(Until.hasObject(By.res(\"topics_list\")), 5000)\n    flingElementDownUp(topicsList)\n}"
