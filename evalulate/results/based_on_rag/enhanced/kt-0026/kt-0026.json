{
  "reason": "The issue occurs during the shutdown sequence of `MultiWorkerDispatcher` where a worker thread may attempt to resume a continuation on an already terminated worker. This happens due to a race condition between channel closing and worker termination.",
  "location": [
    "kotlinx-coroutines-core/native/src/MultithreadedDispatchers.kt",
    "MultiWorkerDispatcher"
  ],
  "fix": "Modify the `close` method in `MultiWorkerDispatcher` to ensure all workers are terminated before closing the channel. The fix should first request termination of all workers and then close the channel to prevent any pending resumes on terminated workers."
