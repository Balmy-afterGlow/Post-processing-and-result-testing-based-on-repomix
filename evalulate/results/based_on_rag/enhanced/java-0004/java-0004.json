  "reason": "The issue occurs when 'spring.cloud.service-registry.auto-registration.enabled' is set to false, which prevents the creation of the 'nacosRegistration' bean due to the @ConditionalOnProperty condition in NacosDiscoveryAutoConfiguration. However, NacosDiscoveryClient still requires this bean, leading to a startup failure.",

  "fix": "Modify the NacosDiscoveryAutoConfiguration to conditionally create the NacosRegistration bean based on both the auto-registration property and the presence of NacosDiscoveryProperties. Update the @ConditionalOnBean annotation for NacosRegistration to include NacosDiscoveryProperties as an alternative condition."
