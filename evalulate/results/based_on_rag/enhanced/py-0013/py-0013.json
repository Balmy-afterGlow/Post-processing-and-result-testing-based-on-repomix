  "reason": "The issue occurs because rich tries to get the current working directory (cwd) unconditionally during import, which fails if the cwd has been deleted.",
  "location": [
    "rich/__init__.py"
  ],
  "fix": "Modify the `_IMPORT_CWD` initialization to handle cases where the cwd doesn't exist by providing a fallback path. For example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ntry:\n    _IMPORT_CWD = os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    _IMPORT_CWD = os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser('~'))\n```"
