{
  "reason": "The issue occurs because `docker-compose logs` fails when any service has a non-readable logging driver (like 'none'), even when no specific service is requested. The current implementation doesn't filter out services with unsupported logging drivers when no specific service is specified.",
  "location": [
    "compose/cli/main.py"
  ],
  "fix": "Modify the logs command implementation to filter out services with non-readable logging drivers when no specific service is requested, similar to how `docker-compose up` handles it. Only fail when explicitly requesting logs for a service with a non-readable driver."
