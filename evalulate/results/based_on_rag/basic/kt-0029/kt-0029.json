{
  "reason": "The issue occurs when multiple @Transient fields are present in a Kotlin data class, causing a duplicate option exception during JSON adapter creation. This happens because the KotlinJsonAdapterFactory is not properly handling multiple transient fields.",
  "location": [
    "com.squareup.moshi.kotlin.reflect.KotlinJsonAdapterFactory"
  ],
  "fix": "The KotlinJsonAdapterFactory needs to be updated to properly handle multiple @Transient fields by filtering them out before creating the Options for the JsonReader. The fix would involve modifying the create() method in KotlinJsonAdapterFactory to exclude all transient properties from the options creation process."
