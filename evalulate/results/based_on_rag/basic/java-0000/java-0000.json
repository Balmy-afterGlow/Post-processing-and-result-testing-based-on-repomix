  "reason": "OkHttp's current implementation explicitly excludes caching for HTTP 302-308 redirect responses, even though RFC 2616 allows caching these responses when proper cache headers are present.",
  "location": [
    "okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java"
  ],
  "fix": "Modify the isCacheable() method in CacheStrategy.java to allow caching of 302-308 responses when proper cache headers (Cache-Control or Expires) are present. The fix would involve removing these status codes from the exclusion list and letting the cache headers determine cacheability."
