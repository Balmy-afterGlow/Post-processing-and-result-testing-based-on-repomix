  "reason": "The issue was that the validation code for the 'filters' parameter in the Conv2D layer only checked for negative values, allowing 0 to pass through. However, the error message indicated that only positive values were expected, which should logically exclude 0 as well.",

    "keras/layers/convolutional/base_conv.py"
  ],
  "fix": "The fix modified the validation condition from 'filters < 0' to 'filters <= 0' to properly catch zero or negative values. Additionally, the error message was updated to be more clear and consistent, stating that a strictly positive value is expected and including the received value in the message."
