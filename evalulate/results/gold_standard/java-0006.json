{
  "reason": "The issue was caused by the Particle Editor automatically flipping images upside down in the preview window due to the 'emitter.setFlip(false, true)' setting being applied by default. This setting was forcing all images to be displayed flipped vertically (the second parameter 'true' indicates vertical flip).",
  "location": [
    "extensions/gdx-tools/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tools/particleeditor/EffectPanel.java"
  ],
  "fix": "The fix involved removing the 'emitter.setFlip(false, true)' calls from the EffectPanel.java file. By eliminating these lines, the images are no longer automatically flipped in the preview window, matching their appearance when saved and loaded from a file."
