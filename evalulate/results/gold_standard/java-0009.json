  "reason": "The issue occurred when trying to decode a resource file (arsc) in an APK, leading to a NullPointerException. The root cause was that the ResValueFactory.factory method did not handle null values for the 'value' parameter, which caused the NullPointerException when attempting to call startsWith() on a null value.",
  "location": [
    "brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/res/data/value/ResValueFactory.java"
  ],
  "fix": "The fix adds a null check at the beginning of the ResValueFactory.factory method. If the 'value' parameter is null, it now returns a new ResFileValue with an empty string as the value and the provided rawValue. This prevents the NullPointerException by ensuring the method can handle null inputs gracefully."
